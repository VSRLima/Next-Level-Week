# Next-Level-Week
Here are my exercises done with an event called [Next Level Week](https://blog.rocketseat.com.br/primeira-next-level-week/), that's teach us about coding, how to deal with an interview and etc. These exercises are a project that we're doing during a week(08/03 until 08/07), that's a site for a plataform called Proffy.
